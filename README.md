A second attempt at a react-rethinkdb-journal w/ a better ES6 boilerplate from https://github.com/jachinte/webpack-express-rethinkdb-boilerplate .

1. Install dependencies with npm install.

2. Set up rethinkdb (make sure you have it installed first). In another terminal, run rethinkdb. Open http://localhost:8080/  and you will see the RethinkDB administration console. In the Tables section, make sure you have a database called test with a table called turtles.

3. Go back to your other terminal and run npm start.

4. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/.
